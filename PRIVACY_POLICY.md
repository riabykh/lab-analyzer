## 2. Data Collection and Processing

We designed LabWise to minimize data collection and processing. Our core principle is local-only processing.

### 2.1 Local Processing
- All laboratory data analysis occurs locally in your browser
- Health data is not transmitted to our servers by default
- Results are processed using client-side artificial intelligence
- No personal health information is stored on our systems

### 2.2 Minimal Server Data
We may process limited technical data for essential service operations:
- IP addresses in transient server logs (retained ≤ 30 days)
- Timestamp and user agent for security monitoring
- Error logs for service debugging (anonymized)

### 2.3 Third-Party Payment Processing
If you purchase premium features:
- Payment data is processed by independent third-party payment processors
- We receive only operational status signals (e.g., "active subscription")
- No financial or payment card data is stored on our systems
- Payment processors act as independent data controllers

## 3. Lawful Basis for Processing

Our processing is based on:
- **Legitimate interests** for security monitoring and abuse prevention
- **Contract performance** for providing paid services
- **Legal obligation** for essential business records

## 4. Data Retention

- Technical logs: Automatically deleted within 30 days
- Session data: Cleared when you close your browser
- Local storage: Under your control via browser settings
- Payment status: Retained only while subscription is active

## 5. International Data Transfers

Where we use infrastructure providers outside your jurisdiction, we implement appropriate safeguards including EU Standard Contractual Clauses. Health data remains on your device by design.

## 6. Your Rights Under GDPR

You have the right to:
- Access your personal data
- Rectification of inaccurate data
- Erasure of your data
- Restriction of processing
- Data portability
- Object to processing
- Withdraw consent (where applicable)

To exercise these rights, contact: mykyta.lysenko@rialys.eu

Note: As most data is processed locally on your device, many rights can be exercised directly through your browser settings.

## 7. Cookies and Local Storage

We use minimal browser storage:
- Essential session cookies for service functionality
- Local storage for user preferences (optional)
- No tracking or analytics cookies
- You can clear all local data via browser settings

## 8. Security Measures

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures:
- Secure hosting infrastructure
- Encrypted data transmission
- Regular security updates
- Least-privilege access controls

However, no system is completely secure. Keep your device and browser updated.

## 9. Children's Privacy

This service is intended for users aged 16 and above. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 16 without appropriate legal basis and parental consent.

## 10. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share personal data with third parties except:
- As required by law
- With your explicit consent
- For essential service providers (under strict data processing agreements)

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect legal, technical, or business changes. Material changes will be notified with reasonable advance notice. The effective date above indicates when this policy was last updated.
